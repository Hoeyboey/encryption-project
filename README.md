# encryption-project
Just a small project I did when I started working on things.

So, when I started learning how to code things, I wanted to try a little project. This was it! Written in Java, it's an incredibly basic little project that encrypts something you input using Random(). Very basic, slightly more effective than a shift cipher, but requires a key which you then input using the built-in decryption tool (using Random()'s built-in capability of a seed). 

It simply uses an array of basic characters and a few symbols, plus lower and upper case characters, to shuffle things around. The input of "Hello" will have upper and lower case letters put in, plus possibly symbols. For example, the input "Hello" gave the result "UAkkb" plus the key -780470977186219474, and would be case-sensitive when decrypting.

If I was going to going to continue working on it, I'd add in the possibility to choose your own key for encryption, plus support for further characters.

For the interesting stuff, go to encryption-project/cipher-project/src/cipher/project and that's where you'll find things.
